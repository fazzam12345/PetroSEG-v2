## Introduction 🌟
This project is a web application built using Streamlit and Tensorflow. It performs unsupervised segmentation on uploaded images. The segmented image can be downloaded, and the colors of the segments can be customized.

---

## Acknowledgments 
This code is inspired from the project [pytorch-unsupervised-segmentation](https://github.com/kanezaki/pytorch-unsupervised-segmentation) by kanezaki. The original project is based on the paper "Unsupervised Image Segmentation by Backpropagation" presented at IEEE ICASSP 2018. The code is optimized for thin section images and microscopy analysis.
